# "Gone Fishing" MCP Server

## Dev Setup

### Things you'll need
**API Keys**
* `openai` - [Link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=responses)
    * Unfortunately, OpenAI's API isn't free. You'll also need a few credits ðŸ˜­
* `tomorrow.io` - [Link](https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/api-authentication)
    * Tomorrow.io offeres a free rate-limited plan.

### Steps
1. Clone Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phelanjo/gone-fishing-mcp.git
cd src
```

2. Install Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv/
source /venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

4. Start Server
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Now you can access the Swagger docs locally at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and play around with the endpoint.

## Future Considerations
* Storing data more efficiently (or at all)
* Handle prompts for multiple bodies of water
* Look for ways to improve NLP accuracy in finding bodies of water (Maybe just build a database instead?)
* Get accurate water data. 
    * USGS (water service) has an API, but there isn't much useful data in there based on the queries I was performing. 
    * If there isn't a better way, perhaps we could do estimations?
* Unit Tests!
